# Mantis Documentation

[Mantis](https://www.mantis.app/) is a vertically integrated intent pipeline complete with expression, execution, and settlement. This is accomplished via the Mantis protocol and Mantis rollup. 

Mantis synergizes with the [Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/) via the [Picasso Network](https://www.picasso.network/) to deliver secure interoperability. Ultimately, Mantis strives to establish a decentralized market for cross-domain intent expression.

At its core, Mantis operates with a solver network that powers chain abstraction. But what does this actually mean?

- **Generalized intents:** An intent is an expression of what a user wants to achieve when they interact with a blockchain protocol. Intents are parts of transactions that require other parts to satisfy all of a user's constraints. Intents are a promising solution for improving user experience and outcomes. Mantis optimizes intent settlement via a network of entities called **solvers**. These solvers compete to provide best execution for intents. Unlike other existing intent frameworks, intents are cross-domain on Mantis. This means intent can be accepted from various chains and applications with final settlement to any IBC-enabled blockchain.
- **CoWs:** Coincidence of Wants (CoWs) is an occurrence when one party’s desired transaction is coincidentally the opposite of another party’s desired transaction. Thus, these two transactions can be used to settle one another as opposed to leveraging a third party intermediary like an exchange. Settlement via CoWs is generally optimal to settlement on exchanges as it means there are no fees or delays caused by participation of a third party.
- **Native yield:** Mantis Accounts are network-level accounts on the Mantis Rollup that can be used for participating in on-chain actions. Mantis Account users will earn native yield for any assets deposited to the Mantis L2. Therefore, assets held in Mantis Accounts earn yield even when not actively being used.
- **Single and cross-chain RFQs:** Request for quote (RFQ) is a type of quote-driven trading. Here, a buyer invites sellers to bid on their transaction. RFQ prioritizes the transaction initiator’s best interests via a competition to fulfill the other side of a trade. RFQ-based systems are a superior option to standard DEXes. Key benefits include clearer, customized prices as well as enhanced transaction privacy and security. Mantis brings these benefits to Solana for the first time as the first RFQ system on this network. Moreover, Mantis is compatible with RFQs on or between any IBC-enabled chain.

**This is the future for how users will interact and curate on-chain experiences.**

Through this architecture, key benefits to users are:

1. RFQ system on Solana
2. Capital efficiency via native yield
3. Best execution of intents
4. A simplified, abstracted cross-chain DeFi experience
