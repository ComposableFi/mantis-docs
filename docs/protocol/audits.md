Mantis is completing an audit with [Ottersec](https://osec.io/), an auditing firm that has secured leading projects such as the Solana Foundation, OlympusDAO, Algorand, Sui, and Squads. Thus far, Ottersec has secured over $5.69 billion in total value locked, with over $1 billion in vulnerabilities patched.
