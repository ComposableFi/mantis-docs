# Ecosystem

The components of the Mantis ecosystem synergize with the Picasso Network and the IBC Protocol. This enables Mantis’s cross-chain capability.

## The IBC Protocol

At Mantis, we believe the ideal cross-chain communication solution is the [IBC Protocol](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/). It facilitates communication between different blockchain ecosystems. As we have [previously described](https://medium.com/picasso-network/why-ibc-everywhere-is-the-key-to-cross-chain-defi-041bed829acd), the benefits of IBC are that it is [trustless](https://medium.com/@Picasso_Network/ibc-as-the-end-game-of-bridging-a-comparison-analysis-on-trust-dcc01e0d9377), secure, censorship-resistant, permissionless, cost-effective, and natively interoperable. Mantis uses IBC to coordinate work between chains. This involves communicating cross-domain execution plans as well as forming enforceable cross-chain commitments.

## The Picasso Network & Its Restaking Pool

The [Picasso Network](https://picasso.xyz/) aims to deliver ecosystem-agnosticism to DeFi. It executes on this vision via the Picasso Layer 1: a Cosmos SDK blockchain that acts as an IBC hub between Cosmos and non-Cosmos IBC-enabled chains. Picasso is the first censorship-resistant, natively-secured cross-ecosystem interoperability solution (via cross-ecosystem IBC). Picasso has also created the [first Solana restaking layer](https://app.picasso.network/solana-staking/).

Initially, the IBC connected the [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/) and [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) chains. The Picasso Network has since expanded upon the IBC so that it also interoperates with [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Kusama](https://kusama.network/), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), and [Solana](https://solana.com/). Picasso is also working to create more IBC connections. The project’s ultimate goal is to connect all major blockchain ecosystems over IBC.

The Picasso Network and its IBC connections enable the Mantis framework to be cross-chain capable. Specifically, Mantis transactions are grouped into IBC bundles on Picasso for shipment based on domain. These bundles are then sent from the Mantis rollup over Picasso IBC and out to relevant blockchains for settlement.

Moreover, the Restaking Layer on Picasso coordinates the agents that have a combination of stake in different chains. Commitments formed between these actors draw upon this Restaking Layer.

Because all cross-chain activities on Mantis leverage Picasso and IBC, there will be cross-pollination of revenue which will accrue to Picasso’s native PICA token.
