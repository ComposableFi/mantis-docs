# Mantis Token

The Mantis token is the native utility token for the Mantis framework, supporting various network functionalities. Mantis will be deployed as an native token on the Mantis rollup.

## Use Cases

Use cases for the Mantis token are as follows:

- **Security:** Mantis may be staked to secure the Mantis rollup
- **Settlement Payment:** Mantis is used for settle transactions on Picasso
- **Fee Sharing:** Staked Mantis will receive a percentage of revenue generated
- **Network Fees:** lsMantis is used to pay fees on the network, and settle on Picasso

More information will become available on the Mantis token post token generation event.

## Tokenomics

Revenue is collected on the Mantis framework via a 0.4% fee on transactions, distributed to the following parties:

- Mantis stakers - 50%
- AVS Restakers - 30%

## lsMantis

lsMantis represents a yield-bearing form of Mantis issued as a receipt token when a user stakes their tokens on the Mantis rollup. lsMantis is issued by the Mantis framework to provide a pool of liquidity for flash loans and tips.

How this works is as follows:

- Fees are paid in lsMantis
- Sequencer/leader selection is determined by Mantis
  - Mantis is staked into a contract on the Restaking Layer of Picasso; the sequencer uses this economic security for leader selection
  - This contract can then be delegated to a pool that can be used for flash loans by searchers
