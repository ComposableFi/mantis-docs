# Mantis Use Cases

## UX: Execute Anywhere from One Location

Crypto users need to take many steps to hunt for the best opportunities. There are lots of people on X that know what they’re doing and suggest/curate DeFi strategies for the average user. Still, the steps might be unclear or daunting.

Mantis thus introduces a platform that is natively cross-chain and simplifies the overall crypto user experience (UX). Mantis vastly improves the UX by carrying out all types of cross-domain transactions and abstracting away the complexity involved in the process. With Mantis, users do not have to spend time identifying the best opportunities to satisfy their intents, only to find that these opportunities are no longer available by the time they have explored all options. Instead, the best opportunities are identified and executed upon by Mantis.

Overall, users are able to execute anywhere that is IBC-enabled directly from the Mantis app.

Since Mantis makes DeFi more accessible and appealing, the broader industry is better positioned for mass adoption.

## Freedom of Choice, Delivering Cross-Domain MEV & PFOF

In the Mantis ecosystem, cross-domain MEV is potentiated from cross-chain intent settlement. A single solution to an intent can involve a number of different domains. Searchers can access the order flow from these solutions not only within each domain but also between domains by accessing the mempool. Cross-domain MEV can be extracted based on this knowledge.

Benefits of this MEV extraction approach for different ecosystem participants are as follows:

- **Proposers:** These entities propose which transactions to include in the next block by looking at which transactions in the mempool pay the highest priority fee. Thus, proposers are able to take advantage of MEV opportunities.
- **Searchers:** These entities extract MEV by running complex algorithms. On Mantis, searchers extract MEV from the presence of transactions in pre-processed blocks proposed by proposers.
- **Users:** A portion of revenues from proposers, searchers, and others can route to users to offset user gas fees (as explained below).

We at Mantis believe that this cross-domain MEV could impact the price of intent settlement in a positive way: decreasing cost for users. Specifically, the funds generated by this cross-domain MEV extraction can be used for pay-for-order-flow (PFOF). PFOF is a term originating from traditional finance. In PFOF, a market maker pays a broker for routing their clients’ trades to the market maker. Thus, market makers benefit from increased order flow (and thus increased earnings), while brokers earn money by effectively selling the order flow of their users to market makers. Moreover, clients can benefit from reduced trading costs.

This concept remains essentially the same in the DeFi context: market makers pay order flow originators to route trades to them. Benefits to participants in DeFi PFOF models are as follows:

- **Solvers:** On Mantis, solvers are independent entities that play a market making role. These parties benefit from increased order flow, resulting in increased earnings.
- **Order flow originators:** These are protocols that generate user orders (or intents, on Mantis). Such protocols make money from selling order flow to block builders.
- **Users**: End users can have reduced (or even completely eliminated) gas costs on their transactions.

On Mantis, we plan to implement a mechanism where solvers are able to partially or fully pay for users’ gas costs using funds they earn from PFOF and MEV extraction.

## Future Explorations

There are a number of ways in which Mantis envisions expanding and improving our Mantis intent settlement framework. These areas of research are described in [our Research Forum](https://research.composable.finance/t/the-research-rfp-program-current-rfps/309).
