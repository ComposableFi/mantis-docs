# About Us

## The Journey to Mantis

Mantis was developed by the [Composable Foundation](https://www.composablefoundation.com/) and is a part of their mission to resolve frictions in the cross-chain DeFi space. These frictions are a significant factor preventing the industry from achieving user-friendliness and mainstream adoption.

Composable has always been to support DeFi users by improving the cross-chain DeFi space, it has evolved in lockstep with the industry in order to best deliver upon this mission. The following are key milestones in the Composable Foundation’s journey to developing Mantis:

**1\. Starting in Polkadot**

Composable began its journey in the Polkadot ecosystem. At this time, cross-chain message passing (XCMP) had not been fully developed. Composable started building the new infrastructure and developer tooling to expand the interoperability reach in the ecosystem.

**2\. Expanding To Cosmos IBC**

Composable then expanded into the Cosmos. This allowed Composable to leverage the Cosmos SDK and IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol to enhance its capabilities and expand its reach across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

Composable then pioneered the implementation of IBC to facilitate secure, censorship-resistant, and permissionless cross-chain communication. These efforts have connected more ecosystems than ever before and broken new ground in blockchain interoperability.

Building off these developments, Composable introduced the concept of “IBC Everywhere” in February of 2023 through Picasso. Composable has since tirelessly championed this initiative as a beacon of decentralization.

**3\. Introducing the Picasso Network**

The Composable Foundation introduced the Picasso Network as part of its quest to enhance cross-chain interoperability. The Picasso L1 Protocol enables secure asset transfers and multi-asset restaking through cross-chain IBC. Picasso’s IBC connections link:

- The Interchain (IBC-enabled Cosmos SDK chains)
- Ethereum
- Solana
- Polkadot and Kusama relay and parachains

Plans are in place to introduce additional Picasso IBC connections including one for Bitcoin.

**4\. Introducing Mantis**

We decided to build our own application to leverage the significant cross-chain, trust-minimized infrastructure now built for the Picasso Network. **Mantis allows users to easily use and benefit from Picasso’s IBC connections. Simultaneously, Mantis routes order flow through these connections.** Thus, these two projects add value to one another.

## Mantis Mission

At Mantis, we believe that the future of DeFi is cross-chain. This is exemplified by:

- The various blockchain ecosystems that are currently popular—all with their own unique benefits
- The various bridging infrastructures that have arisen to connect these ecosystems

However, we also believe that interacting with this cross-chain DeFi space is overly complicated. To perform cross-chain operations, users must navigate through multiple applications and user interfaces. Along the way, they are often subject to frictions such as:

- High security risks
- High latency
- Frequent transaction failures

Mantis was thus built from the thesis that intents and chain-agnosticism are keys to resolving these issues in the cross-chain space:

- **Intents** enable users to specify what they want to happen without having to specify how. This flexibility simplifies the user experience while enabling best execution.
- **Chain-agnosticism** abstracts the cross-chain experience away for users. Users are able to simply state what assets they want moved where. Then, the actual cross-chain process happens completely on the backend.

Through this streamlined user experience, we believe that DeFi will onboard new users that otherwise would not be comfortable navigating the space. As a result, DeFi is better positioned for mainstream adoption.
