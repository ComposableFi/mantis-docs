# Develop - How Other Protocols Can Use Mantis

Many projects within the DeFi space can leverage Mantis by tapping into the remote procedure call (RPC) of the Mantis Intent Software Development Kit (SDK). This is shown below:

Some examples of these projects that can benefit from integrating Mantis are as follows:

**Crypto Wallets:** Wallets can use Mantis to become intent-centric. This allows their users to submit intents for their desired crypto transaction outcomes. Intent settlement will then be carried out and optimized by Mantis solvers. Intents are executed on any chain that is connected to IBC using the optimal solution achieved. This delivers best execution for users while providing a streamlined UX within the existing wallet UI.

**Order Flow Originators:** Any protocols that originate order flow can integrate Mantis to process orders. This can make these protocols intent-centric and provides chain-agnostic intent settlement over IBC.

**Trading Bots:** Bots’ strategy algorithms can use Mantis-based trading opportunities. Settlement of these trades will then be optimized by Mantis solvers, providing best execution to users. Bot projects benefit from this opportunity financially; any bot that has partnered with Mantis and directs unique order flow to Mantis automatically receives that revenue share, once Mantis processes the given order.

**AI Agents:** Artificial intelligence (AI) agents can partner with Mantis to enable strategically timed swaps along the Mantis protocol. Partner protocols’ existing tech stacks can be used to generate these AI agents. AI agents will then submit user intents at optimal times to Mantis. Intent settlement will be further optimized by Mantis solvers. Similarly to partner trading bots, partner AI agents also receive revenue based on order flow origination. Specifically, any AI agent that has partnered with Mantis will receive a revenue share when they have successfully directed unique order flow to Mantis.

**Order Flow Destinations:** DeFi protocols can integrate Mantis to receive order flow from the platform. Order flow destinations include DEXes, lending protocols, or derivatives platforms.
